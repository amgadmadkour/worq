In 1989 Howard Stephen Berg was acknowledged in the 1990 Guinness Book of World Records as the \"Fastest Reader in the World\" for reading more than 25,000 words a minute (over 416 words per second) and writing more than 100 words a minute. Berg has been honored further in publications such as, \"Who's Who Among Emerging Leaders, and 2,000 Notable American Men\". In addition to being acknowledged as the world\u2019s fastest reader, Berg is probably best known for his speed reading program, \"Maximum Power Reading\". Based on schematic processing, Berg\u2019s method of speed reading uses brain maps Brain mapping to achieve greater comprehension and to speed learning. In college, Berg needed to complete a four year psychology program in one year. Out of necessity, Berg started putting together a system designed to help him meet this goal. Once Berg discovered Malcolm Knowles\u2019 Malcolm Knowlestheory of andragogy Andragogy he experimented with speed reading and his own brain map to develop his own approach to learning, as well as speed reading. Berg then taught others his method of speed reading and learning strategies. He discovered that most people were able to duplicate the skills in his systems and improve their reading, comprehension and learning abilities with great success. It was this discovery that gave him the passion to make helping others learn more effectively his life's work. Berg also develops learning programs on other subjects including, \"Super Writing Secrets\", \"Super Memory Secrets\", \"Super Math Secrets\", as well as collaborated with Dr. Kuni Michael Beasley to create \"The Ultimate Learning System\". In 1996 Berg and Beasley founded the Gateway Preparatory School in the Dallas/Ft. Worth, TX Metroplex. Berg\u2019s book, \u201CSuper Reading Secrets\u201D, published by Time Warner is in its 28th reprint at the time of this article. Berg\u2019s credibility as a speed reader has been attacked over the years, yet a double blind efficacy study conducted in 1998 by Strategic Services showed that participants ages 11 to 64 using Berg\u2019s home study speed reading program on their own within four hours, increased their reading speed while maintaining or increasing their reading comprehension rate. The media has put Berg to the test too. On Cleveland's Morning Exchange, Howard completed an 1100 page book and scored a perfect score on recall. He was retested three years later on the same book using his recall from the previous show again with perfect recall. Dick Cavett had Berg read his autobiography in 90 seconds and he again demonstrated perfect recall. On Live with Regis and Kathie Lee, Berg read a 200 page book, \"Going to the Movies,\" by Quentin Crisp, and scored 100% on the extensive test given by the author on air. [citation needed] Neil Cavuto had Howard Berg on Your World With Neil Cavuto read both the Senate and House health care bills as they were released in the fall of 2009. Berg explained that he used inspectional reading, to complete both the Senate 1500 page Bill and a week later the 1920 page House Bill in under an hour each. Berg then answered questions and summarized as much of the bill\u2019s content as time permitted with total accuracy. Cavuto dubbed Berg \"the Yoda\" of speed readers."@en .}

At the same time it is a welcome to those who are joining and introduces them to the special history and traditions of their new organization. This celebration builds organizational camaraderie and esprit de corps. It supports a sense of continuity through change. For the United States Army, a Hail and Farewell is most often celebrated at a formal dining in when there is a change in command. This provides the unit with a formal setting in which to welcome the new commander and honor the old commander. Some units may elect a less formal Dining Out in which family member and other non-military guests are encouraged to take place in the unit change. There are no official requirements outlined by the United States Army to have a Hail and Farewell celebration. It is up to each unit to carry out this tradition as they see fit. The United States Navy, on the other hand, has specified that by custom the ship's officers must give a formal dinner when their new captain arrives. There may also be a formal dinner for the departing captain and these may be combined into one formal Hail and Farewell dinner."@en .}

In 1913\u20141915 he led the Arctic hydrographic expedition on the ships \"Taimyr\" and \"Vaigach\" with the purpose of further exploration of the Northern Sea Route. In 1913, Vilkitsky's expedition discovered Severnaya Zemlya, perhaps one of the most important Russian discoveries in the Arctic at the time. Other discoveries were an island that now bears his name, as well as the islands of Maly Taymyr and neighboring Starokadomsky. In 1914\u20141915, Vilkitsky's expedition made the first through voyage from Vladivostok to Arkhangelsk, discovered Novopashenniy Island, and described the southern coastline of Severnaya Zemlya. In 1918, Vilkitsky was appointed head of the first Soviet hydrographic expedition, which never took place due to its seizure by the interventionists in Arkhangelsk. In 1920, Vilkitsky emigrated to Britain. In 1923 and 1924, Vilkitsky led commercial expeditions in the Kara Sea at the invitation of the Soviet foreign trade organizations. Later in his life, Vilkitsky was employed as a hydrographer in the Belgian Congo. Boris Vilkitsky died in Brussels in 1961."@en .}

He is chiefly known for being Agent General for Reparations to Germany, from October 1924 to May 1930. Afterwards, in 1931, he became an associate at J. P. Morgan. He died at age 45, from a heart attack. His son S. Parker Gilbert, born 1934, was chairman of Morgan Stanley during the 1980s. Parker Gilbert was educated at Rutgers College, and received a L.L.B. from Harvard Law School. At age 27, he was offered a cabinet post in the Wilson Administration, as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, and continued to serve in the Harding Administration. In 1924, he was appointed Agent General for Reparations by the Allied Reparations Commission, succeeding the temporary Owen D. Young. In that capacity, he was responsible for the execution of the Dawes Plan. Under the Young Plan, the Bank for International Settlements was created, nullifying the position of Parker Gilbert."@en .}
